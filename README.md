## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to install dependencies and run the project components separately for the front-end, back-end, and extension. 

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend` 

2.  **Install the necessary dependencies:**
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `npm install` 
    
3.  **Start the development server:**
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `npm run dev`
